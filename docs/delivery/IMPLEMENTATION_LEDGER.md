### bo-u2r.1 - Scaffold Maven Spring Boot project

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Status | Closed |
| Agent | mayor |
| Branch | `work/bo-u2r-1-scaffold-maven` |
| PR | https://github.com/AgenticFunProject/booking/pull/6 |
| Merge commit | `b23c9df` |
| Started UTC | 2026-05-18T08:41:50Z |
| Completed UTC | 2026-05-18T09:02:47Z |
| Elapsed wall time | 20m 57s |
| Timing source | Copied from bead `started_at` and `closed_at` fields for GitHub-readable reporting |
| Files changed | `pom.xml`, `MAVEN.md` |
| Spec | `specs/001_project_setup.md` |

Delivered:

- Added Maven `pom.xml` for `booking-service`.
- Configured Java 21 and Spring Boot `3.5.14`.
- Added core Spring Boot starters, PostgreSQL/Flyway, Lombok, SpringDoc, Spring Boot test, and embedded PostgreSQL test dependencies.
- Added `MAVEN.md` documenting Maven commands and wrapper generation.

Verification:

- `git diff --cached --check` passed.
- `pom.xml` parsed successfully with Python `xml.etree.ElementTree`.
- `mvn compile` was attempted but blocked because no Java runtime was available and Maven reported `JAVA_HOME` was not defined correctly.

Notes:

- Maven wrapper was not generated in this environment. `MAVEN.md` documents `mvn -N wrapper:wrapper` for a Java 21/Maven machine.

### bo-u2r.2 - Create base package structure

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Status | Closed |
| Agent | mayor |
| Branch | `work/bo-u2r-2-package-structure` |
| PR | https://github.com/AgenticFunProject/booking/pull/11 |
| Merge commit | `f66c10b` |
| Started UTC | 2026-05-18T09:46:28Z |
| Completed UTC | 2026-05-18T09:46:54Z |
| Elapsed wall time | 26s |
| Timing source | Agent-recorded UTC timestamps copied into this file for GitHub-readable reporting |
| Files changed | `src/main/java/com/cargo/booking/**/package-info.java`, `docs/delivery/IMPLEMENTATION_LEDGER.md`, `docs/delivery/QUALITY_LOG.md` |
| Spec | `specs/001_project_setup.md` |

Delivered:

- Added the base `com.cargo.booking` package tree.
- Added Java package markers for controller, service, repository, model/entity, model/enums, DTO request/response, config, exception, client, client DTO, mapper, and security packages.

Verification:

- `git diff --check` passed.
- `mvn compile` was attempted but blocked because no Java runtime was available and Maven reported `JAVA_HOME` was not defined correctly.

Notes:

- Empty packages are represented with `package-info.java` files so the package structure is tracked by Git.

### bo-u2r.6 - Add project ignore and developer docs shell

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Status | In review |
| Agent | mayor |
| Branch | `work/bo-u2r-6-ignore-docs-shell` |
| PR | https://github.com/AgenticFunProject/booking/pull/12 |
| Merge commit | Pending |
| Started UTC | 2026-05-18T09:49:38Z |
| Completed UTC | 2026-05-18T09:50:36Z |
| Elapsed wall time | 58s |
| Timing source | Agent-recorded UTC timestamps copied into this file for GitHub-readable reporting |
| Files changed | `.gitignore`, `README.md`, `docs/delivery/IMPLEMENTATION_LEDGER.md`, `docs/delivery/QUALITY_LOG.md` |
| Spec | `specs/001_project_setup.md` |

Delivered:

- Added project ignore rules for build output, IDE/editor files, environment files, logs, OS files, and test/coverage output.
- Updated the README to describe the generated service status, implementation plan, delivery evidence files, and current Maven commands.

Verification:

- `git diff --check` passed.
- Portable absolute-path scan passed.

Notes:

- Maven wrapper artifacts are not ignored so a future wrapper-generation bead can commit them if needed.
